## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


JavaScript is the language of the web, if you want to code for the web, you need to know JavaScript inside and out. From humble beginnings, JavaScript has grown to a powerful and complex language with features such as classes, promises, arrow functions, generators, string templates and many others.

In this course, you'll learn all of the essential concepts of the JavaScript language, right up to date with the latest improvements to the language in ECMAScript 2016. That's right: all of them!

You'll start with the very fundamentals of the language: variables and datatypes. Then each lesson you'll build knowledge, from data structures like arrays and maps, to loops, control structures, and functions. Along with the basics of the language, you'll also learn some key built-in APIs for manipulating data, AJAX, and working with the web browser DOM. Finally, you'll get a look at some of the most powerful and widely-used web APIs that are supported by all modern browsers.

There's a lot to learn, so let's jump in!
